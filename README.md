# Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project implements a **Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using network traffic data.

The system is capable of classifying traffic as **normal** or **malicious** in real time through a **Streamlit-based user interface**.
